    This is a factory function to build HopInfo object from url.
    It allows only telnet and ssh as a valid protocols.

    Args:
        url (str): The url string describing the node. i.e.
            telnet://username@1.1.1.1. The protocol, username and address
            portion of url is mandatory. Port and password is optional.
            If port is missing the standard protocol -> port mapping is done.
            The password is optional i.e. for TS access directly to console
            ports.
            The path part is treated as additional password required for some
            systems, i.e. enable password for IOS devices.:
            telnet://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<enable_password>
            <enable_password> is optional

        verify_reachability: This is optional callable returning boolean
            if node is reachable. It can be used to verify reachability
            of the node before making a connection. It can speedup the
            connection process when node not reachable especially with
            telnet having long timeout.
